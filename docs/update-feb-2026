## Update Feb 2026 | Lennox Crowe

#### Notes on the environment
- deepsensor modifications
- neuralprocesses modifications

#### Things we tried
- not using edge masking
- not using per-coordinate normalisation...

#### Things to try next
- per-coordinate normalization, but not performing this on the difference between (stations/NZRA) to ERA5. I.e. predicting per-location z-normalized temperature, rather than per-location z-normalized residuals between the station/target and ERA5. There is not a strong relationship between per-coordinate normalized station-era5 residual and NZRA-era5 residual.
